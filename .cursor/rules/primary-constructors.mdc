# Primary Constructors

Prefer C# 12 primary constructors for classes that only need to capture constructor parameters as fields.

- Use primary constructor syntax: `public sealed class MyService(ILogger<MyService> logger) : IMyService`
- For computed values from options, use a private readonly field with an initializer or a static helper.
- Keep an explicit constructor when the constructor body has non-trivial side effects (e.g. mutating injected HttpClient, multi-step setup).
- When using primary constructor parameters, reference them directly in the class body; they are in scope as private fields.

```csharp
// Prefer
public sealed class MyHandler(ILogger<MyHandler> logger) : IHandler
{
    public void Do() => logger.LogInformation("Done");
}

// Over explicit constructor when only assigning fields
public sealed class MyHandler : IHandler
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyHandler> _logger;
    public MyHandler(ILogger<MyHandler> logger) { _logger = logger; }
}
```
