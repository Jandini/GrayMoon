# Windows environment: EOL and shell

This project is developed on **Windows**. Follow these rules for all generated code and terminal commands.

## Line endings (EOL)

- **Use Windows line endings (CRLF)** when creating or editing any file.
- Do **not** use Unix line endings (LF only) in generated code or scripts.
- In terminal commands that create or modify files, ensure output uses CRLF if the result is source code (e.g. when writing to a file from a script).

## Terminal / shell

- **Shell:** The default shell is **PowerShell** on Windows.
- **Command chaining:** In PowerShell, do **not** use `&&` to chain commands. Use one of:
  - Semicolon: `;` (e.g. `cd path; dotnet build`)
  - Separate commands in separate invocations
  - Or run in cmd: `cmd /c "cd path && dotnet build"`
- **Paths:** Prefer Windows-style paths in commands when needed; paths with spaces must be quoted (e.g. `"path with spaces"`).
- **Examples:**
  - Wrong: `cd "c:\project" && dotnet build`
  - Right: `cd "c:\project"; dotnet build`
  - Right: `Set-Location "c:\project"; dotnet build`

Applying these rules avoids `InvalidEndOfLine` and similar Windows shell errors when running generated commands.
