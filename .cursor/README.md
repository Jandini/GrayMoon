# Cursor rules for GrayMoon

This folder contains rules and instructions for Cursor when working on this repo.

## Windows environment

- **Line endings:** Always use **Windows (CRLF)** in generated or edited code. Do not use LF-only.
- **Terminal:** Commands run in **PowerShell**. Use `;` to chain commands, not `&&` (e.g. `cd path; dotnet build`).
- **The request summary** must be very brief - one or two sentences. Ask if I want more details before generating more.

See `.cursor/rules/windows-eol-and-shell.mdc` for the full rule applied to all edits and terminal usage.
See `.cursor/rules/summary-of-changes.mdc` for the full rule applied to all edits and terminal usage.
